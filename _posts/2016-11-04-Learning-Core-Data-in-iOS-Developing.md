## Database
Some times you need to store large amount of data or query it in a sophisticated manner. And we want it to be object-oriented.

Core data framework is very powerful.

## How does it work?
* Create a visual mapping between database and objects;
* Create and query for objects using object-oriented API;
* Access the "columns in the database table" using **@property**s on those objects.
