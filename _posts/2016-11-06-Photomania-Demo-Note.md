This might be the toughest and the biggest demo in this iOS course. Here I put my note collection here as reference for later use.

# I. Create the Project
- Create a project with single view as normal.

# II. Database Setup

## 1. Create the Database
Create a database file. Then, add the following two entities into the database:
	 
- **Photo**
- **Photographer**

## 2. Define the Schema [^schema] visually.

- Add properties to them respectively. (e.g. title, url, data, name etc.)

- Add relationship between the two entities:
	- For **Photographer** in **Photo**, the relationship is ***whoTook***
	- For **Photo** in **Photographer** the relationship is the same one, but called ***photos***.

		(**NOTICE**: The relationship type here should be set as ***To Many***, because one photographer may take multiple photos.)
	
## 3. Create NSManagedObject Subclasses
- Create NSManagedObject Subclasses automatically using XCode.
	- Select both entities;
	- click "Editor", then "Create NSManagedObject Subclasses";
	- The correspondent subclasses **Photo.h/Photo.m** and **Photographer.h/Photographer.m** are created in the project and can be found in the project navigator.
	- Notice that in XCode 7 and later, the generated new subclasses include: entity and their CoreDataProperties category like this:

[^schema]: A **schema** is a collection of database objects (as far as this hour is concernedâ€”tables) associated with one particular database username. This username is called the schema owner, or the owner of the related group of objects. You may have one or multiple schemas in a database.
