It's all about how core data works.

## Database
Some times you need to store large amount of data or query it in a sophisticated manner. And we want it to be object-oriented.

Core data framework is very powerful.

## How does it work?
* Create a visual mapping between database and objects;
* Create and query for objects using object-oriented API;
* Access the "columns in the database table" using **@property**s on those objects.
* Create a core data model, the visual map in xcode.

## An Object Context
You need an `NSManagedObjectContext`.

It is the hub around which all Core Data activity turns.

### How do I get one?
There are two ways: 

1. Create a `UIMangedDocument` and ask for its `managedObjectContext` (a `@property`).
	
	
	
2. Click the "Use Core Data" button when you create a project (only works with certain templates, then you AppDelegate will have a managedObjectContext @property).


```objc
@property (readonly, strong) NSPersistentContainer *persistentContainer;
// The persistent container for the application. This implementation creates and returns a container, having loaded the store for the application to it.

- (void)saveContext;
```
