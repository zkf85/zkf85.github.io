## Try writing markdown blogs with MacDown

Oh! This is really an awesome editor as I'm typing these words. I can see what it looks like as published on the right. As long I wanna try some syntax in markdown that I'm not quite familiar, I just try it, and take a look:

	this is a block
	this is a block
	this is a block

This is really nice, and efficiency.The inline block is like `this is an inline block`. this is a link: [google](http://google.com) This is really awesome!!! I like it.

Now, it's time to start my technical blog writing.
