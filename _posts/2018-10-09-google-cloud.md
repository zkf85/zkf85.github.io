After experiencing google cloud for couple of week, I'd like to write something down here. On the one hand, there're lots of tips, necessary knowledge and pitfalls to remember and check. One the other hand, just cannot resist to say something about this giant and complicated service system.


### Why Google Cloud 
So where shall we start? OK, first why Google Cloud? The reason for me is that it's actually free to use. Well although it's not literally free. As long as you apply an "free trial" account and enter your credit card info (they won't automatically charge you, for sure), they will grant you $300 credit within one year to use for free completely. I have to say the google is really generous in this case. 

This screen shot below is my current balance as I've already used the google cloud for training with or without GPUs for about 2 weeks. $300 is worth several month decent using.
