## Try writing markdown blogs with MacDown

Oh! This is really an awesome editor as I'm typing these words. I can see what it looks like as published on the right. As long I wanna try some syntax in markdown that I'm not quite familiar, I just try it, and take a look:

	this is a block
	this is a block
	this is a block

This is really nice, and efficiency.The inline block is like `this is an inline block`. this is a link: [google](http://google.com) This is really awesome!!! I like it.

Now, it's time to start my technical blog writing.

## How to insert an image in the blog?

Example:
add the following code:

```
![My first image inserted](/public/img/ios-10-nimblechapps.png)
```

the path in the parentheses is the image local url.

The result is like this:
![My first image inserted](/public/img/20161103-0-ios10.png)

add snippet:

```objective-c
#import <Foundation/Foundation.h>
@interface

@property (nonatomic, strong) UITableView *tableView;
@end
```
